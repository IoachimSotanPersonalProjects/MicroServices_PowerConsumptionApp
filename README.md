# MicroServices_PowerConsumptionApp
A web application using a microservice architecture in which we read data from different sensors, use that data to compute graphics and statistics and send notifications to the client app. With this project I learned a lot about Java Spring technology, authentication mechanism using JWT, Docker for deploying the app and Angular for frontend.
